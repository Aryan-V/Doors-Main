# Doors

An iOS application used to notify when a member of our friend group is at a communal door and would like it to be opened. Also includes a feature for roommates to notify each other when they need the room for a preset duration. Built in XCode.

Designed and developed by Aryan Vaswani and Ojaswee Chaudhary. 

Brainstorming assistance by Utkarsh Prasad and Nishesh Arora.
