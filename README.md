# Doors

An iOS application used to notify when a member of our friend group is at a communal door and would like it to be opened. Also includes a feature for roommates to notify each other when they need the room for a preset duration. Built in XCode.

Designed and developed by Aryan Vaswani with the help of Utkarsh Prasad, Ojaswee Chaudhary, and Nishesh Arora.
